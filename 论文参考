2. Cyberattacks in Satellite Networks

Broadly, attacks on satellite communication networks can be classified into two types: (a) electronic attacks and (b) cyberattacks [39]. The electronic attacks target the electronic devices through which the system transmits and receives data. Such electronic attacks include jamming and spoofing. On the other hand, cyberattacks target the data directly and the systems using the data. A cyberattack refers to the deliberate and nefarious attempt to breach a information system for malicious purposes [40].
Cyberattacks can be used to take control of information systems and devices, intercept, eavesdrop on, and corrupt data. The antennas on satellite stations and ground stations, as well as the systems connecting ground stations to satellite networks, are all potential entry points for hackers to launch cyberattacks [41]. Attacks that target data interception attempt to store data as it is transmitted through a satellite information system or eavesdrop the flow of data over the connected network [42]. An attacker will be able to verify the success of their security breach attempt in almost real-time, even if a satellite service provider is unaware of the attack while it is happening or even after it has occurred. During a data corruption attack, malicious software, such as malware, is introduced into the system and the data are altered to purposefully display incorrect information. As hackers may successfully conceal their identities and carry out completely irreversible attacks, these types of crimes are challenging to identify and track.
Cyberattacks can potentially be used to gain access and control of an orbiting satellite system and ultimately be able to execute commands on the satellite communication systems onboard. Such types of attack will be extremely difficult to attribute and the repercussions will be irreversible if the attacker gains complete control of the systems and alters or makes changes in a way that may cause severe unrecoverable damage. The service provider might take notice of the attack but would not be in a position to take any affirmative action as it will be too late to reverse the damage. Such attacks, which include gaining complete control of satellites, can cause severe collateral damage and may lead to the disabling of the target satellite, leaving it to drift in its orbit in uncontrolled fashion or even worse the path can be slightly drifted and cause collisions with other satellites. We now briefly summarize various kinds of cyberattacks.
Denial-of-service (DoS) and DDoS attacks: The attacker will overwhelm or flood the information system in such a way that leads to a denial of service to the intended legitimate users. The attack is typically carried by a single computer or device. The DDoS attack is a type of DoS attack in which the attacker uses several distributed devices to flood the data traffic. The distributed devices are usually compromised bots [43].
Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack: The attacker places itself in the communication link between two parties in order to intercept, eavesdrop, or corrupt the data being exchanged between the involved parties. Such an attack will enable the attacker to steal login passwords and personal information and spy on the victim [44].
Phishing and spear-phishing attacks: Phishing attacks are based on using social engineering and technical tricks to manipulate the users. The attackers disguise as a trusted party to send emails and messages that will lead to the installation of some malicious software or the revealing of personal and sensitive information. A spear-phishing attack is a targeted attack by gathering some typical information about the target users or organization to increase the probability of success of a phishing attack. As this attack is very specific and targeted, it is difficult to identify and defend against [45].
Drive-by attack: Such attacks are a common way to install and download malicious software without any explicit permission from the user. This usually happens while visiting a compromised website that will automatically download and install to infect the device, steal information, or corrupt stored data. This is also known as a drive-by download as this does not require any action on the part of victim. A drive-by download attack can take advantage of the security vulnerability of an app, operating system, or web browser [46].
Password attack: Passwords are required to obtain access to an information system, storage devices, and emails. Password attacks use special techniques and software to guess the passwords of users to gain access to their system. Such access to a user’s password can be obtained by smart guessing by combining date of birth, place of birth, pet’s name etc., using social engineering and tricks and gaining access to a password database [47].
SQL injection attack: Structured Query Language (SQL) attacks are mostly common with database-driven websites. The attacker inserts SQL commands that can lead to access, modify, and delete databases or completely shut them down [48].
Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack: XSS attacks inject malicious code into a trusted website. The users visiting the website will be vulnerable to give away personal information or download software onto their computers [49].
Eavesdropping attack: Eavesdropping attacks occur by intercepting, modifying, or deleting the data that are being exchanged between two parties. It takes advantage of an unsecured communication network to snoop on the data transfer in transit [50].
Malware attack: Such attacks uses malicious or unwanted software designed to harm the information system. It can lead to stealing, deleting, or encrypting the data, gaining access and control of the device, locking the device, and injecting some spy software. Some examples include virus, worm, ransomware, trojan horse, bots, spyware, adware, etc. [51].
For launching a DDoS attack on the LEO satellite network, the attacker will use several compromised bots/users located on the ground by combining various kinds of cyberattack techniques to gain access or control of the end users on the ground spread across a vast geographical area. After gaining complete control of these users, it can flood and overwhelm the data traffic of the downlink/uplink or inter-satellite link of the satellite communication link to deny services to the genuine users.
3. Random Routing Algorithm

In the context of densely connected LEO communication networks, an attacker can easily plan a DDoS attack to congest an inter-satellite communication link. This is expected due to the fact that when the routing algorithm is deterministic, and with the assumption that the attacker knows the algorithm as well as the network grid (each satellite’s location), it is feasible to predict how the network will route a packet in the inter-satellite communication network. This is also supported by the ICARUS study. One way to address the challenge could be to add randomness in the routing algorithm that will cause it to be more difficult for the attacker to successfully perform a DDoS attack. First, we define the following two terms in the context of attacks: cost and MaxUp.
The cost of an attacker is defined in the following way: how many resources in terms of traffic volume (Gbps) an adversary has to use in order to be successful in achieving the attack’s goal. For example, if one bot generates 10 Mbps of traffic volume, then the ISL capacity of 10 Gbps would mean 1000 bots transmitting 10 Mbps each to the ISL network.
Detectability/MaxUp is defined as follows: If the attacker just targets one satellite to launch its attacks then a sudden change in traffic volume to a single node in the network would be easily noticeable. To avoid such detectable situation, attackers distribute their traffic volume over several satellites in the LSN by placing several bots on the ground. Therefore, the detectability/MaxUp is defined as the maximum absolute change in the bandwidth caused by the attacker across the LSN for the up-link transmission.
When the algorithm is less deterministic, this means that the attacker has to send more packets in order to congest the target ISL. This is expected to happen as the attacker has to cover a greater number of cases probabilistically. The transmission of more packets over the network means increasing the cost (sending more packets from multiple ground stations/bots) or the MaxUp (sending more packets from a single ground station). For example, let us assume that the routing algorithm is a BFS (breadth-first search). Given a grid of satellites and a source and destination of ground stations, this algorithm will return a similar path no matter how many times it is being run. For the attacker, that means it knows the exact route of each packet sent, which in turn allows the attacker to only send as many packets as needed to congest a target ISL.
On the other hand, assume the algorithm returns the three shortest paths leading from the source to the destination. Now, the attacker must take into account every possible short path, which may be more than just three. That means the attacker has to send more packets. If the attacker sends more packets from the source station that would increase the MaxUp since more traffic from a single station is easier to recognize. The attacker can alternatively send more packets from multiple other ground stations, but that would increase the cost since the attacker would need to have a larger botnet to have access to more ground stations. In conclusion, sending more packets means increasing the cost (sending more packets from multiple ground stations) or MaxUp (sending more packets from a single ground station).
In order to add randomness to the routing algorithm, we select one of four algorithms to be used with weighted distribution. These four algorithm are chosen from the algorithms evaluated in ICARUS and already implemented in the framework: k-DG, k-DS, k-SP, and k-LO. These algorithms include [8]:
Shortest paths (k-SP): The k-sp algorithm finds k paths between the source and destination in the network with the minimum length [52]. This algorithm distributes traffic among the k-shortest paths in the satellite communication network [53].
Ground-to-ground disjoint paths (k-DG): The algorithm considers k-shortest paths with node disjoint paths, i.e., without any shared uplinks, downlinks, or inter-satellite links. The node disjoint paths only share the source and destination points [54].
Satellite-to-satellite disjoint paths (k-DS): This algorithm finds the k shortest paths with the node disjointness forced only on the inter-satellite links while allowing overlaps in the paths of the uplinks and the downlinks.
Limited-overlap shortest paths (k-LO): The algorithm finds the k shortest path between the source and destination ensuring that these paths are sufficiently dissimilar to each other. It is an implementation of the ESX algorithm, as shown in [55], in that it finds the k shortest paths with a similarity score of less than 50%.
The proposed random algorithm k-RAND is summarized in Algorithm 1. We generate a random variable A between 0 and 1. For the values of A between 0 and 𝑎1, we select the shortest path (k-SP) routing algorithm; for values between 𝑎1 and 𝑎2, k-DG is selected and so on. The values of 𝑎1, 𝑎2, and 𝑎3 will be determined based on the maximization of the statistics of the cost of attack. There will be a trade-off between these two competing measures (cost and MaxUp) for the DDoS attacks against LSNs.2. Cyberattacks in Satellite Networks

, 𝑎2, and 𝑎3, we formulate a Bayesian optimization problem. The Bayesian method is a derivative free approach to find the minima of expensive-to-evaluated functions. The cost function of the optimization is the average cost of the DDoS attacks on the LSN. The solution is then obtained using the Bayesian approach
